Our application.properties DB info is still commented out.
In Spring Boot, if an embedded database is listed as a

Database Initialization and Cleanup
When we are performing integration testing with a database
â€¢ Each test should run from a known state
Before each test, perform initialization
Insert sample data
After each test, perform cleanup
Delete the sample data


Testing Approach

Each test should run from a known state


@BeforeEach ->Insert sample Data
@Test Method One
@AfterEach  ->Delete sample Data

@BeforeEach ->Insert sample Data
@Test Method Two
@AfterEach  ->Delete sample Data
